# Hi there, I'm Fadli Ahmad, you can call me Fadli~ 

I'm a data analyst, and I currently work remotely at Dagangan. Before Dagangan (Social Commerce), I worked in several companies and industries, such as Pahamify (Edutech), Tanihub (Agri-Tech), and Mahakam Beta Farma (Pharmacy). Apart from working as a Data Analyst, I have also been a mentor at RevoU (Data Analyst Bootcamp).

I am currently exploring and learning about emerging tech stacks in data engineering such as Data Build Tools (DBT), and Airflow, and trying to get hands-on with setting up a data warehouse, cloud computing, and other data engineering tools.

Here is some fun fact about me: 

    🎓 I studied Informatics and Management when I was in college 
    📊 A Data Analyst who wants to switch or gain exposure in the ⚙️ Data Engineering Field
    📖 I used this GitHub for my project and portfolio
